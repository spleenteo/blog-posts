# Jon and Vangelis, The friends of Mr Cairo
Ammetto si soffrire ormai di una forte dipendenza da Spotify, un servizio che negli ultimi anni mi ha permesso di scoprire un sacco di musica nuova, cosa che non ho sperimentato per molto tempo. La radio proprio non funziona da questo punto di vista, almeno per me.

Voglio provare ad integrare sul sito il player web di Spotify e per fare una prova ho scelta l'ultima canzone aggiunta alla mia lista dei brani preferiti. Un pezzo bellissimo, del 1981, sonorità elettroniche su un mood anni 30. Vangelis generalmente mi annoia e non lo sentivo da decenni, ma questo pezzo... tanta roba!

Da [wikipedia](The_Friends_of_Mr_Cairo):

> The Friends of Mr Cairo is the second album by Jon and Vangelis, released in 1981. There are two editions of this album, with different sleeves. Both versions were released in 1981 within a few weeks of each other. The title track, "The Friends of Mr Cairo", peaked at No. 1 on the Canadian singles chart in late 1981, though this track was not a hit elsewhere. The second edition of the album includes the single "I'll Find My Way Home", which stayed for 14 weeks in the Swiss charts and peaked at No. 1 on 7 March 1982. It also peaked at No. 6 in the UK.[2] The album was #2 in Canada for 3 weeks, and was #15 in the Best of 1981.[3] "State of Independence" was later a hit single for Donna Summer, and a decade later for Moodswings with Chrissie Hynde on vocal. Anderson also later re-recorded that song on his solo album Change We Must, released in 1994.
> 
> The title track and its accompanying music video serve as an ode to classic Hollywood films of the 1930s and 1940s, including references to the classic film noir The Maltese Falcon. The track incorporates sound effects and voice impressions of the stars of the era, most notably Humphrey Bogart, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Jimmy Stewart.

> Joel Cairo (Mr Cairo) is the name of the character played by Peter Lorre in The Maltese Falcon.
